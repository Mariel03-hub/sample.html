    <h1>Poem for Friend</h1>

On someone else’s estate <br>
running through it to avoid <br>
the outdoor wedding there is a grave <br>
in a little copse of trees <br>
so panting  we hide out there <br>

How beautiful to lie down <br>
not to be the dead ones there <br>
whose eye sockets are filled with dirt <br>
nothing is theirs anymore <br>
you pass me a crumpled joint <br>
swaying a little like a poem <br>
while black birds wail in the air <br>
and the commuter train wails <br>
all we have to do is make tacos <br>
tonight and be friends </p>
